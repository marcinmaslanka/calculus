# 🔍 Semiconductor Basics Quiz

## ❓ Question 1:
Explain the concept of holes (in addition to electrons) in a semiconductor!

<details>
  <summary>🅰️ Answer</summary>

A **hole** in a semiconductor is the absence of an electron in the **valence band**. When an electron gains energy and moves to the **conduction band**, it leaves behind a hole. This hole behaves like a **positive charge carrier** because neighboring electrons can jump into it, causing the hole to effectively move in the opposite direction of electron flow. Holes contribute to electrical conduction, especially in **p-type** materials.
