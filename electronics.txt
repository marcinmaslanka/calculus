## What are the Kirchhoff’s circuit laws?

Kirchhoff’s circuit laws are fundamental rules used in electrical circuit analysis:

1. Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):
The algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in an electrical circuit is zero. Mathematically: ∑ Iin = ∑ Iout or ∑ I = 0 (at a node) This means that the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving the junction.

2. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):
The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop or mesh in a circuit is zero. Mathematically: ∑ V = 0 (around a closed loop) This means that the sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) and potential drops in a closed loop is zero.

These laws apply to both DC and AC circuits and are essential for analyzing complex electrical networks.

## State Ohm’s law! Is it applicable in AC systems?

Ohm’s law states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. It is mathematically expressed as:

V = I × R

where:

V = voltage (volts)
I = current (amperes)
R = resistance (ohms)
Yes, Ohm’s law is applicable in AC (alternating current) systems as well. However, in AC circuits, you may need to use impedance (which includes resistance and reactance) instead of just resistance, so the relationship becomes:

V = I × Z

where Z is the complex impedance.

## Can you write the Node Admittance Matrix for a circuit?

The Node Admittance Matrix (Y-matrix) for a circuit expresses the relationship between node voltages and currents in matrix form, using admittances (the reciprocals of impedances).

For an n-node circuit (excluding the reference/ground node), the matrix equation is:

I = Y · V

Where:

I is the column vector of node currents (excluding ground),
V is the column vector of node voltages (excluding ground),
Y is the nodal admittance matrix.
The elements of the Y-matrix are:

Y_ii (diagonal): The sum of all admittances connected to node i.
Y_ij (off-diagonal, i ≠ j): The negative sum of admittances directly connecting nodes i and j.
Mathematically, for nodes 1 to n:

Y_ii = sum of all admittances connected to node i,
Y_ij = - (sum of admittances directly connecting node i and node j), for i ≠ j.
Example for a 3-node circuit: | I₁ | = | Y₁₁ Y₁₂ Y₁₃ | * | V₁ | 
                              | I₂ | = | Y₂₁ Y₂₂ Y₂₃ | * | V₂ | 
                              | I₃ | = | Y₃₁ Y₃₂ Y₃₃ | * | V₃ |

This matrix is constructed based on the circuit’s topology and component values.

## How are the complex impedances of a capacitor and an inductor defined?

Capacitor: The complex impedance Z_C of a capacitor with capacitance C at angular frequency ω is defined as Z_C = 1/(jωC), where j is the imaginary unit.

Inductor: The complex impedance Z_L of an inductor with inductance L at angular frequency ω is defined as Z_L = jωL, where j is the imaginary unit.

Node-voltage analysis (also called nodal analysis) and branch-current analysis (also called mesh or loop analysis) are systematic methods for determining unknown voltages and currents in an electrical network.

Branch-current analysis:

Assign current variables to branches or define loop/mesh currents.
Apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) to each independent loop: the sum of voltage drops around a closed loop is zero.
Express voltages in terms of branch currents and component resistances or impedances.
Solve the resulting set of equations to find the branch currents.
Calculate voltages across components as needed using Ohm’s or the generalized impedance law.
Both methods use Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law to form a solvable system of equations describing the circuit behavior.
