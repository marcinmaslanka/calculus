## What are the Kirchhoff’s circuit laws?

Kirchhoff’s circuit laws are fundamental rules used in electrical circuit analysis:

1. Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):
The algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or junction) in an electrical circuit is zero. Mathematically: ∑ Iin = ∑ Iout or ∑ I = 0 (at a node) This means that the total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving the junction.

2. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):
The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop or mesh in a circuit is zero. Mathematically: ∑ V = 0 (around a closed loop) This means that the sum of the electromotive forces (emfs) and potential drops in a closed loop is zero.

These laws apply to both DC and AC circuits and are essential for analyzing complex electrical networks.
