What are complex numbers? Why and when are they required?
Give the rules for computing (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with
complex numbers!


Write down Euler’s formula! Describe the Cartesian form and the polar form of complex
numbers! How can both forms be converted into each other?

What are absolute value (magnitude) and argument (phase) of a complex number?

Differentiate (w.r.t. the variable t; c 2 R; j2 = −1) the following functions:
f(t) = c, f(t) = t2, f(t) = cos(ct), f(t) = et, f(t) = ejct

Integrate (w.r.t. the variable t; c 2 R; j2 = −1) the following functions:
f(t) = c, f(t) = t2, f(t) = cos(ct), f(t) = ejct, f(t) =  1, |t| < 1/2
0, else

How is the product of a matrix with a vector defined? Which requirements do both
quantities have to fulfill, such that the product exists?

How is the scalar product of vectors defined? How is the cross product between two
vectors defined?

What is the Euclidean norm of a vector?

Let a basis, i.e., a set of vectors spanning a space, be given. How can we calculate an
orthonormal basis from the given one?

Explain the meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors! How are they calculated given a
(square) matrix?

What is the meaning of curl, div, and grad? Express them in Cartesian, polar, and
cylindrical coordinates!
